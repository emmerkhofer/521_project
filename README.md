# 521_project
By Xinyu Zhang, Yuhui Tang

## Introduction:
* `521project_code.py` and `util.py` are our coding part which includes complete pipline, from data reading, data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training to evaluation result reporting.

* `data.zip` is originally from https://myleott.com/op-spam.html, but we manually changed the folder structure for more convinient batch reading, the data itself remains unchanged. The new data is zipped to `data.zip`

* `final_report.pdf` is our completed final report.


## Code Running Instruction: 
Download `data.zip`, unzip it and put data folder, `521project_code.py` and `util.py` in the same folder. 
* Method 1: Use IDE to open `521project_code.py` and select all code to run.
* Method 2: 
1. Open command line
2. `cd your_folder_for_data.zip_521project_code.py_and_util.py`
3. `python 521project_code.py`


Ps: The Xgboost model takes long time to run, almost 8 hours.
