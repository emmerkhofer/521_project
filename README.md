By Xinyu Zhang, Yuhui Tang

## Introduction:
* `521project_code.py` and `util.py` are our coding part which includes complete pipline, from data reading, data preprocessing, feature extraction to model training.

* `data.zip` is originally from https://myleott.com/op-spam.html , but we manually changed the folder structure for more convinient batch reading, the data itself remain unchanged. The new data is zipped to `data.zip`

* `final_report.pdf` is our completed final report.


## Code Running Instruction: 
Download data.zip, unzip it and put data folder, 521project_code.py and util.py in the same folder.

Ps: The Xgboost model takes long time to run, almost 8 hours,
